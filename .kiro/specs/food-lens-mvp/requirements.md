# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Food Lens is an AI-powered restaurant platform that enables restaurants to upload menus and automatically generate high-quality food images. The MVP includes restaurant onboarding, menu management, AI-powered food advisory through AWS Strands, and voice synthesis via ElevenLabs. The platform is built as a containerized Next.js application deployed on AWS App Runner, using Supabase for database and authentication, and AWS S3 for object storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Restaurant Onboarding and Authentication

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want to create an account and manage my restaurant profile, so that I can access the platform and manage my menu items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restaurant owner visits the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a registration form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a restaurant owner submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create an account using Supabase Auth
3. WHEN a restaurant owner logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and provide access to their dashboard
4. WHEN a restaurant owner completes registration THEN the system SHALL create a restaurant profile with name and email in the database
5. IF a restaurant owner tries to access protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 2: Menu Item Management

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want to create, read, update, and delete menu items, so that I can maintain an accurate representation of my offerings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restaurant owner adds a new menu item THEN the system SHALL save the item with name, price, optional ingredients, and description
2. WHEN a restaurant owner views their menu THEN the system SHALL display all menu items associated with their restaurant
3. WHEN a restaurant owner updates a menu item THEN the system SHALL save the changes and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN a restaurant owner deletes a menu item THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and associated S3 images
5. IF a restaurant owner tries to access another restaurant's menu items THEN the system SHALL deny access through row-level security

### Requirement 3: Automatic Image Generation

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want high-quality images automatically generated for my menu items, so that customers can see appealing visuals of my dishes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restaurant owner creates a new menu item THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger image generation using Google Nano Banana API
2. WHEN the image generation API is called THEN the system SHALL use a controlled prompt format: "A high-quality food photo of [Dish Name], served on a white ceramic plate, isolated on transparent background, top-down/angled view"
3. WHEN an image is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL upload it to AWS S3 with proper naming conventions
4. WHEN an image is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL store the S3 URL in the menu_items.image_url field
5. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without blocking menu item creation
6. WHEN displaying menu items THEN the system SHALL show the generated images with proper fallback handling

### Requirement 4: AI Food Advisor Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to ask questions about menu items and receive intelligent responses, so that I can make informed dining decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer submits a query about a dish THEN the system SHALL forward the request to AWS Strands Agent
2. WHEN AWS Strands processes a query THEN the system SHALL have access to GetDishInfo tool for menu item details
3. WHEN AWS Strands processes a query THEN the system SHALL have access to NutritionLookup tool for nutritional information
4. WHEN AWS Strands generates a response THEN the system SHALL return concise, friendly, and dietary-aware information
5. IF a user indicates allergies or medical concerns THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions and provide medical disclaimers
6. WHEN a response is generated THEN the system SHALL return the text to the frontend for display

### Requirement 5: Voice Response Generation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to hear AI responses as voice audio, so that I can receive information in an accessible and engaging format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI Food Advisor generates a text response THEN the system SHALL send the text to ElevenLabs TTS API
2. WHEN ElevenLabs processes the text THEN the system SHALL receive audio in MP3 or WAV format
3. WHEN audio is generated THEN the system SHALL either store it temporarily in S3 or keep it in memory
4. WHEN audio is ready THEN the system SHALL provide it to the frontend for playback
5. IF TTS generation fails THEN the system SHALL still display the text response without blocking the user experience

### Requirement 6: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want my data to be secure and isolated from other restaurants, so that I can trust the platform with my business information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restaurants access data THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security to isolate restaurant data
2. WHEN handling S3 assets THEN the system SHALL use signed URLs or appropriate access controls
3. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL encrypt keys and follow least privilege principles
4. WHEN displaying nutrition information THEN the system SHALL include appropriate disclaimers
5. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL retain minimal personally identifiable information

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow and Live Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see live updates as I build the application, so that I can iterate quickly and validate changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the application THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for both frontend and backend changes
2. WHEN making code changes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the browser to show updates
3. WHEN developing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow testing without full deployment cycles
4. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback in the development environment
5. WHEN integrating external APIs THEN the system SHALL support development/testing modes with mock responses when needed

### Requirement 8: System Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want the system to be reliable and performant, so that I can have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run as a containerized Next.js application on AWS App Runner
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN users access the platform THEN the system SHALL respond within acceptable time limits
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide logs and metrics through CloudWatch and error tracking
